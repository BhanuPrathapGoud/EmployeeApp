Q2. When should one use Maven?
Maven is chiefly used for Java-based projects,
 helping to download dependencies, which refers to the libraries or JAR files.
 The tool helps get the right JAR files for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages. 

After Maven, downloading dependencies doesnâ€™t require visiting the official websites of different software.
 You can visit mvnrepository to find libraries in different languages. 
The tool also helps to create the right project structure in struts, servlets, etc.,
 which is essential for execution.
